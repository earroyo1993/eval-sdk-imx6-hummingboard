	GStreamer is a library that allows the construction of graphs of 
	media-handling components, ranging from simple Ogg/Vorbis playback
	to complex audio (mixing) and video (non-linear editing) processing.
	Applications can take advantage of advances in codec and filter
	technology transparently. Developers can add new codecs and filters 
	by writing a simple plugin with a clean, generic interface. 
	GStreamer is released under the LGPL.
